# fool â™¦ [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spacekookie/fool.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/spacekookie/fool) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/w29yfx0q5kls3013?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/spacekookie/fool)

A powerful git commandline interface which is focused on usability. Use quick keyboard shortcuts to manage your repository, files and commits.

`fool` currently only works on Linux, MacOS (and other Unix-like systems). Windows support is something that is kinda in-the-works.

## How to use

`fool` is centered around keyboard shortcuts. Use the arrow-keys to move your cursor, then press a key to issue an action to the selected file. Some commands (committing, pushing, managing remotes, etc) will trigger the same action, no matter the selected file.
